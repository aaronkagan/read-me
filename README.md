## Overview

### The problems this solves

1. Teachers lack a centralized way to assign and keep track of homework assignments
2. School announcement readers lack an efficient way to gather all the announcements from all the teachers in the school

### The solution

1. Have a centralized board where teachers can post homework assignments as well as upload files to be downloaded by the students
2. Make it so that students and teachers can leave comments on the assignments in case of further questions and clarifications
3. Aggregate all of the teacher's daily announcements in one location for easy access by the office announcement reader

### The challenges

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {

# Installation instructions

## MongoDB setup

- Setup a connection to your own MongoDB instance.
- Create a DB called 'TaskBoard'.
- Import the collections below to get started with some user accounts (mandatory for initial login), default tasks (optional), and announcements (optional).
- At the very least the admin account will need to be imported from the users-initial-setup.json in order to be able to login and create user accounts.

[Initial MongoDB Collections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NFZPyfMk2B-ei-yXQ1pGFGzNlqxnBh_-?usp=sharing)

The passwords included in the setup files are encrypted. Use the password "admin" for all accounts.
You can change the passwords later from the admin panel.
