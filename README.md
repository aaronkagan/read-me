# Installation instructions

## MongoDB setup

- Setup a connection to your own MongoDB instance.
- Create a DB called 'TaskBoard'.
- Import the collections below to get started with some user accounts (mandatory for initial login), default tasks (optional), and announcements (optional).
- At the very least the admin account will need to be imported from the users-initial-setup.json in order to be able to login and create user accounts.

[Initial MongoDB Collections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NFZPyfMk2B-ei-yXQ1pGFGzNlqxnBh_-?usp=sharing)

The passwords included in the setup files are encrypted. Use the password "admin" for all accounts.
You can change the passwords later from the admin panel.
